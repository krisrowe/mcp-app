# Author MCP App

## Overview

This skill guides users through building Python MCP servers and
web APIs that are self-contained, deployable apps. Solutions built
with this guidance work locally (stdio, single user) and deployed
(HTTP, multi-user) without code changes.

## User Journey Map

Every mcp-app solution is used by three audiences across six
recurring journeys. Understanding the map serves two purposes
for this skill:

1. **Authoring context.** When building or reviewing an app,
   every journey below must work end-to-end. Missing journeys
   (e.g., no `probe`, no typed profile flags, no post-deploy
   signing-key retrieval path) are compliance gaps.
2. **Documentation coverage.** The implementing app's README
   and CONTRIBUTING must walk readers through each journey in
   app-specific terms (see the Documentation section). The
   journeys below are what the docs must cover.

### Audiences

- **Developer** — builds or modifies the app; needs architecture,
  tests, compliance, and local validation.
- **Operator** — deploys the app, manages users, rotates
  credentials. May be the developer wearing a different hat, or
  a separate person months later.
- **End user** — registers the app with their MCP client and
  invokes tools. May be a human or an AI agent.

### The six journeys

1. **Install / quick start** — developer clones or installs
   the package, runs tests, confirms it works locally.
2. **Run locally (stdio)** — end user registers the app for
   stdio with their MCP client. May require a local user
   profile with credentials (API-proxy apps).
3. **Deploy (HTTP)** — operator deploys the app to a target
   platform with persistent storage and a secret-managed
   signing key.
4. **Connect admin CLI post-deploy** — operator retrieves the
   signing key from wherever the deployment stored it, then
   runs `my-app-admin connect <url> --signing-key xxx`.
   Config persists per-app in `~/.config/{name}/setup.json`.
5. **Manage users and credentials** — operator adds users,
   rotates backend credentials via `users update-profile`,
   revokes access, issues new tokens. Profile field names and
   descriptions drive CLI help text.
6. **Verify end-to-end and register MCP clients** — operator
   runs `probe` to confirm the deployment serves tools,
   `register` to emit MCP client configuration commands
   (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Claude.ai URL).

The developer typically walks all six during initial release;
the operator returns to journeys 4–6 for every credential
rotation, user addition, or deployment update. Docs must make
the returning operator's path frictionless — they land cold,
months later, without the skills loaded.

## Design goal: self-obsolescence for the solution repo

The processes this skill and its companion `mcp-app-admin`
describe — authoring, reviewing, upgrading, deploying,
redeploying, administering — are all inherently recurring.
Nothing about those processes becomes obsolete. What *can*
become obsolete, per solution repo, are the **skills as
agent-guidance artifacts**.

This skill holds itself to the following bar: when
`mcp-app-admin` (and any other relevant accelerator skills)
are available in the environment during an authoring or
review pass, this skill must absorb their guidance into the
solution repo's own `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and agent
context files (`CLAUDE.md`, `.gemini/settings.json`) — in
app-specific and often more concrete terms than the skills
themselves can offer. After the pass, a future agent opening
the solution repo with **neither skill loaded** must be able
to install, run, deploy, redeploy, connect the admin CLI,
manage users, rotate credentials, register MCP clients, add
or modify tools, and run tests, entirely from the repo's own
files.

The skills remain broadly useful — for lifecycle events
(initial authoring, review, framework upgrade), for repos
that haven't been brought under this discipline yet, and as
cross-cutting references that track framework evolution
before any one repo's docs catch up. But for *this* repo,
after *this* pass, they should not be required for normal
ongoing work.

### Final self-obsolescence check

Before exiting any Mode 1 (greenfield) or Mode 2 (migration)
workflow, verify the bar:

1. Open the solution repo's `README.md` and read it cold.
   Does it walk through all six user journeys in
   app-specific terms, with real CLI names, real profile
   fields, real commands, real env vars? No references to
   "run the author-mcp-app skill" or "see mcp-app-admin"?
2. Open `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Does it teach how to add a tool,
   how to add or modify a profile field, how to run tests,
   and how to satisfy mcp-app compliance rules — without
   pointing a reader back to either skill?
3. Confirm `CLAUDE.md` imports `@README.md` and
   `@CONTRIBUTING.md`, and that `.gemini/settings.json`
   declares both in `context.fileName`.
4. Mentally simulate three representative tasks with an
   agent that has neither skill loaded:
   - Add a tool that calls a new SDK method
   - Rotate a deployed user's backend credential
   - Redeploy a code change and verify the running instance
   Can the agent complete each task using only the repo's
   own docs? If not, identify the gap and fill it in the
   repo's docs — not in conversation, not by relying on
   the skill.

The skill's pass is not finished until the check passes.
Skill-level content that hasn't made it into the repo's own
docs in app-specific form is an uncompleted handoff.

## Framework Choice

This skill supports two approaches:

### Recommended: mcp-app (config-driven)

[mcp-app](https://github.com/echomodel/mcp-app) is a framework that
wraps FastMCP and Starlette. You define tools as plain async functions,
wire up with two lines in Python, and run with one command. No config
files, no framework imports in your tool code.

**What the user gets with mcp-app:**

- **Zero framework code in tools.** Tools are plain async functions.
  No decorators, no FastMCP imports, no framework coupling in
  business code. mcp-app discovers public async functions from the
  module declared in `tools:` and registers them automatically —
  function names become tool names, docstrings become descriptions,
  type hints become schemas.

- **User identity and profile.** Identity middleware runs by default
  in HTTP mode — validates JWTs, loads the full user record (auth +
  profile) in one store read, sets `current_user` ContextVar. The
  SDK reads `current_user.get()` for user identity and profile data.

- **User management out of the box.** REST admin endpoints
  (`POST /admin/users`, `GET /admin/users`,
  `DELETE /admin/users/{email}`, `POST /admin/tokens`,
  `PATCH /admin/users/{email}/profile`) — user registration
  with optional profile data, listing, revocation, token
  issuance, and profile updates with no code.

- **Per-user data storage.** `filesystem` store (default) provides
  per-user JSON under XDG-compliant paths. Custom stores plug in
  via module path. The SDK accesses data through `get_store()`.

- **Typed profile with Pydantic.** Apps declare a profile model
  on the `App` object. Profile data is validated at registration
  and hydrated as a typed object on `current_user.get().profile`.

- **One composition root.** The `App` class declares name, tools
  module, profile model, and store in one place. CLIs (`serve`,
  `stdio`, `connect`, `users`, `tokens`, `health`, `probe`,
  `register`) are derived automatically. The admin CLI generates
  typed flags from the profile model.

- **Free tests for auth, admin, and wiring.** `mcp_app.testing`
  ships test modules that check auth enforcement, user admin, JWT
  handling, CLI wiring, and tool protocol compliance against your
  app. Import them, provide your `App` as a fixture, get 25+ tests.

- **Identity enforced by default.** Every tool is wrapped with
  identity enforcement — if no user is established (HTTP middleware
  didn't run, stdio `--user` wasn't passed), the tool returns an
  error instead of running unauthenticated. You can't accidentally
  ship a wide-open service.

- **Deployable anywhere.** Standard container image, any platform.
  Or use [gapp](https://github.com/echomodel/gapp) for rapid
  deployment to serverless Cloud Run.

**Install:**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/echomodel/mcp-app.git
```

### Alternative: FastMCP (manual wiring)

If the user prefers direct control, already has a FastMCP-based
app, or has requirements that mcp-app doesn't cover, use FastMCP
directly with the `mcp` package. The architecture rules (SDK-first,
thin tools, XDG paths) apply equally to both approaches.

**When to suggest FastMCP directly:**
- User explicitly asks for it
- Existing codebase already uses FastMCP and migration isn't wanted
- Need for custom transport or protocol extensions
- stdio-only tool with no deployment plans
- User wants full control over the ASGI middleware stack

## Modes

This skill operates in three modes depending on what the user
needs. Determine the mode from the user's request and the state
of the current working directory.

### Mode 1: Greenfield — Build a New Solution

User wants to create a new MCP server or web API from scratch.

**First, help them decide: local or remote?**

**Local MCP server (stdio)** makes sense when:
- Works with local files, code, git repos, or system config
- Manages the local workstation or development environment
- Needs fast, low-latency interaction
- Single user, single machine

**Remote MCP server (HTTP)** makes sense when:
- Accesses cloud data or external APIs
- Needs to be available from multiple devices
- Needs multi-user support
- Benefits from always-on availability

Based on this, the solution targets stdio only (simpler — no auth,
no deployment) or stdio + HTTP (needs auth, deployment planning).
Both follow the same repo structure.

### Mode 2: Migration — Port an Existing App

1. Check the mcp-app framework version (see below)
2. Read the existing codebase to understand current structure.
   **If deployment config exists** (e.g., Dockerfile, CI
   workflows, `.tf` files, deployment-tool configs) — do not
   modify it directly. When
   you reach deployment configuration, invoke the appropriate
   deployment skill if one is available. The runtime contract
   in this skill tells you what the app needs; the deployment
   tool's skill knows how to configure it.
3. **Check for existing auth and credential storage.** If the
   app has its own authentication, token storage, or credential
   management — custom middleware, config files, env vars for
   tokens, auth CLI commands, a deployment tool's auth wrapper
   — migrating to mcp-app **replaces all of it.** mcp-app's
   user profile store IS the credential management system now.
   Flag this to the user:
   - Existing tokens become invalid after migration
   - Existing users need to be re-registered in mcp-app's
     user store via the admin CLI
   - Per-user credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens) are stored
     in mcp-app user profiles, not config files or env vars
   - **Delete the old credential code.** Any custom token
     storage (config files like `~/.config/*/token`, env var
     token discovery, `auth` subcommands, `get_token()`
     helpers) is dead code after migration. Do not create
     fallback chains that check both old and new paths —
     that defeats the purpose of migrating. The SDK reads
     credentials from `current_user.get().profile`, period.
   - MCP clients (Claude.ai, Claude Code, Gemini CLI) will
     need new tokens and possibly updated endpoint URLs
   - Check for existing user data on disk or in cloud storage
     that may need format conversion
   - **If a working remote deployment exists**, connect to it
     with the admin CLI to retrieve existing user credentials
     for local registration. Don't ask the user to manually
     extract tokens from browsers or config files when the
     data is already accessible through the running service.
     Use the deployment tool's skills to discover connection
     details (URL, signing key) if needed.
4. Walk through the Compliance Checklist, noting conformance
5. Propose a migration plan in priority order
6. Execute with the user's approval
7. Run the checklist again to verify

### Mode 3: Review — Evaluate Against Standards

1. Check the mcp-app framework version (see below)
2. Run the Compliance Checklist and present results as a table
3. For each failure, explain what's wrong and the fix

### Checking the mcp-app framework version

For any existing app that already depends on mcp-app, ensure
the installed version is current before proceeding. Check how
the dependency is declared (e.g., in `pyproject.toml`) and
whether it pins a specific version or commit.

If it points to a git URL with no pin (e.g.,
`mcp-app @ git+https://...`), the installed version may be
stale even though the dependency declaration looks correct.
Reinstall to pull the latest:

```bash
pip install -e . --upgrade
```

After upgrading, if `tests/framework/` exists, run it:

```bash
pytest tests/framework/ -v
```

If it passes, the app is compatible with the new version. If
any tests fail, investigate before proceeding — the failure
may indicate an API change the app needs to adapt to.

If `tests/framework/` does not exist, that's a compliance gap
— adopt the framework test suite (see Step 5 in Testing and
Validation).

If the app pins a specific version or commit, confirm with the
user whether they want to update before making changes that
may depend on newer framework features.

## Repository Structure

### Single-package (recommended for new apps)

```
my-solution/
  my_solution/
    __init__.py       # APP_NAME, mcp_cli, admin_cli, optional Profile
    sdk/
      core.py         # Business logic — ALL behavior here
    mcp/
      tools.py        # Pure async functions calling SDK
    cli/              # Optional — app-specific Click commands
      main.py
  tests/
    unit/
  pyproject.toml
```

### Multi-package (when SDK, MCP, CLI have different dependencies)

Some apps separate SDK, MCP server, and CLI into independent
installable packages so users only install what they need:

```
my-solution/
  sdk/
    my_solution/      # my-solution-sdk package
      __init__.py     # APP_NAME
      core.py
    pyproject.toml
  mcp/
    my_solution_mcp/  # my-solution-mcp package
      __init__.py     # mcp_cli, admin_cli, optional Profile
      tools.py
    pyproject.toml    # depends on my-solution-sdk, mcp-app
  cli/
    my_solution_cli/  # my-solution package (CLI)
      main.py
    pyproject.toml    # depends on my-solution-sdk
  tests/
```

In multi-package repos, the `App` object goes in the MCP package's
`__init__.py` — that's where mcp-app is a dependency.

### __init__.py — the app's identity

**API-proxy app** (needs per-user credentials):

```python
# my_solution/__init__.py
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from mcp_app import App
from my_solution.mcp import tools

class Profile(BaseModel):
    token: str = Field(description="API token from https://example.com/settings")

app = App(
    name="my-solution",
    tools_module=tools,
    profile_model=Profile,
    profile_expand=True,
)
```

**Data-owning app** (no per-user credentials — just identity):

```python
# my_solution/__init__.py
from mcp_app import App
from my_solution.mcp import tools

app = App(
    name="my-solution",
    tools_module=tools,
)
```

No profile model needed. User identity comes from
`current_user.get().email`. App data lives in the store or
however the app manages its own storage.

### pyproject.toml entry points

```toml
[project]
name = "my-solution"
dependencies = ["mcp-app"]

[project.scripts]
my-solution = "my_solution.cli:cli"           # app's own CLI (optional)
my-solution-mcp = "my_solution:app.mcp_cli"   # serve, stdio
my-solution-admin = "my_solution:app.admin_cli" # connect, users, health

[project.entry-points."mcp_app.apps"]
my-solution = "my_solution:app"
```

One `pipx install my-solution` gives three commands. The
`mcp_app.apps` entry point lets framework tooling discover
the app.

### Rules

- **SDK first.** All behavior lives in the SDK. MCP and CLI are
  thin wrappers.
- **No business logic in MCP tools or CLI commands.**
- **If you're writing logic in a tool or command, stop and move it
  to SDK.**
- **Minimize non-business code.** The goal is to write as little
  code as possible that isn't focused on the problem domain. Use
  mcp-app features when they eliminate boilerplate — that's what
  the framework is for. But don't adopt features the app doesn't
  need. Don't adopt features that don't reduce code, configuration,
  or complexity for this specific app. When existing code handles
  concerns that available tooling already covers — auth, user
  management, server bootstrapping, transport, deployment,
  infrastructure — replace it with the tooling. The goal is to
  shed everything that isn't business logic. If the tooling covers
  most but not all of a concern, work with the user on how to
  close the gap rather than keeping a parallel custom
  implementation.

## MCP Server Setup

### With mcp-app (recommended)

No config files. The `App` object wires everything:

```python
# my_solution/__init__.py
from mcp_app import App
from my_solution.mcp import tools

app = App(name="my-solution", tools_module=tools)
```

Tools module — plain async functions that call SDK methods:

```python
# my_solution/mcp/tools.py
from my_solution.sdk.core import MySDK

sdk = MySDK()

async def do_thing(param: str) -> dict:
    """Do the thing for the current user."""
    return sdk.do_thing(param)
```

**Tool discovery:** mcp-app registers all public async functions
in the tools module as MCP tools. Function name → tool name,
docstring → description, type hints → schema. Functions starting
with `_` are skipped.

**Import carefully.** Any async function imported into the tools
module becomes a tool — including SDK functions. Always use a
class-based SDK so tools call `sdk.method()` and SDK methods
stay hidden from discovery.

**SDK has state** (config, file paths, store) — instantiate:
```python
# Data-owning app (e.g., food logger with local storage)
from my_solution.sdk.core import MySDK
sdk = MySDK()  # holds config, paths

async def do_thing(param: str) -> dict:
    """Do the thing."""
    return sdk.do_thing(param)
```

**SDK is stateless** (just wraps an external API) — use the
class as a namespace via classmethods, no pointless instance:
```python
# API-proxy app (e.g., wraps a financial API)
from my_solution.sdk.core import MySDK
sdk = MySDK  # the class itself, not an instance

async def list_items() -> dict:
    """List items."""
    return await sdk.list_items()
```

```python
# my_solution/sdk/core.py
class MySDK:
    @classmethod
    def _client(cls):
        user = current_user.get()
        return MyClient(token=user.profile.token)

    @classmethod
    async def list_items(cls) -> dict:
        client = cls._client()
        return await client.get_items()
```

Both patterns prevent leakage. The class groups methods and
keeps client creation in one place.

**Escape hatch for existing function-based SDKs:** if
refactoring to a class isn't worth it, import with underscore
prefix:
```python
from my_solution.sdk import get_items as _get_items
```

Identity middleware runs automatically in HTTP mode. Store
defaults to filesystem. No configuration unless adding custom
middleware.

**Run:**
```bash
my-solution-mcp serve              # HTTP
my-solution-mcp stdio --user local  # stdio
```

### With FastMCP (alternative)

```python
# my_solution/mcp/server.py
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from my_solution import APP_NAME
from my_solution.sdk.core import MySDK

mcp = FastMCP(APP_NAME, stateless_http=True, json_response=True)
mcp.settings.transport_security.enable_dns_rebinding_protection = False

sdk = MySDK()

@mcp.tool()
async def do_thing(param: str) -> dict:
    """Do the thing."""
    return sdk.do_thing(param)

app = mcp.streamable_http_app()  # For uvicorn HTTP mode

def run_server():
    mcp.run()             # For stdio mode
```

## User Identity and Profile

### How it works

In HTTP mode, identity middleware validates the JWT, loads the full
user record from the store (auth + profile in one read), and sets
`current_user` ContextVar. In stdio mode, the CLI loads the user
record from the store using the `--user` flag.

The SDK reads it:

```python
from mcp_app.context import current_user

user = current_user.get()
user.email       # "alice@example.com" (HTTP) or "local" (stdio)
user.profile     # typed Pydantic model or raw dict
```

### Two app patterns — same framework, different SDK reads

**Data-owning** (owns user data — food logs, notes):

```python
from mcp_app.context import current_user
from mcp_app import get_store

class MySDK:
    def save_entry(self, data):
        user = current_user.get()
        store = get_store()
        store.save(user.email, "entries/today", data)
```

The SDK reads `current_user.get().email` for user identity. How
it stores data is the app's choice — `get_store()` provides
mcp-app's per-user key-value store, but the SDK can also manage
its own storage (XDG paths, custom databases, etc.) using the
email as the scoping key.

**API-proxy** (wraps external API — financial data, task management):

```python
from mcp_app.context import current_user
import httpx

class MySDK:
    def list_items(self):
        user = current_user.get()
        token = user.profile.token  # typed via Pydantic
        resp = httpx.get("https://api.example.com/items",
                         headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"})
        return resp.json()
```

Both use `current_user.get()`. The middleware is the same (identity
only). The SDK decides what to read from the user context.

### Profile registration

The app declares its per-user profile shape:

```python
# my_solution/__init__.py
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from mcp_app import App
from my_solution.mcp import tools

class Profile(BaseModel):
    token: str = Field(description="Personal access token from https://example.com/settings")

app = App(
    name="my-solution",
    tools_module=tools,
    profile_model=Profile,
    profile_expand=True,
)
```

`profile_expand=True` generates typed CLI flags (`--token`).
`profile_expand=False` accepts the profile as a JSON blob or `@file`.
Profile registration happens automatically when the `App` is
constructed — no separate `register_profile()` call needed.

**Field descriptions are the self-documentation mechanism for
API-proxy apps.** The Pydantic model is the single place where
the app author declares what per-user credentials the app needs.
The field name is the app author's choice (`token`, `api_key`,
`github_pat`, `plaid_access_token` — mcp-app doesn't enforce
or assume any naming). The `Field(description=...)` should say
what the credential is, what system it connects to, and where
the operator can obtain it.

This matters because the admin CLI surfaces field names and
descriptions in `--help` output for `users add` and
`users update-profile`. An operator (or agent) managing a
deployed instance discovers what credentials the app needs
by running `my-solution-admin users add --help` — no source
code or documentation needed. This is the re-discovery path:
months later, when a token needs rotating, the CLI tells you
what each field is for.

**When building an API-proxy app, always include
`Field(description=...)` on every profile field.** A bare
`token: str` works mechanically but gives operators nothing
to work with when they encounter the field in a CLI or admin
tool. A good description answers: what is this, what system
does it authenticate to, and where do I get one.

**Propagate this into the implementing app.** When creating or
reviewing an API-proxy app:

1. **Code comment on the Profile class** — explain that field
   descriptions drive CLI help text and are the primary way
   operators discover what credentials the app needs.
2. **CONTRIBUTING.md** — document that profile fields must
   include `Field(description=...)` and what a good description
   looks like. This ensures future contributors maintain the
   self-documentation when adding or changing profile fields.

These are not optional polish — they are the re-discovery
mechanism. Without descriptions, an operator rotating a
credential six months later sees `--token` in `--help` with
no explanation of what token, for what system, or where to
get a new one.

### User management

Each mcp-app solution generates three CLI entry points:

```bash
my-solution              # app's own CLI (optional)
my-solution-mcp serve    # MCP server (HTTP or stdio)
my-solution-admin        # admin: connect, users, tokens, health, probe, register
```

**Always prefer the per-app admin CLI** (`my-solution-admin`)
over the generic CLI (`mcp-app`). The per-app CLI stores its
connection config per app — each app remembers its own target
(local or remote) and signing key in
`~/.config/{name}/setup.json`. This lets you return to an app
in a future session and immediately run admin operations without
re-discovering how or where it was deployed. The generic CLI
stores only one connection at a time — connecting to a different
service overwrites the previous one.

The framework currently tracks one connection per app (a single
deployment environment, whether local or remote). If the same
app is deployed to multiple environments, `connect` switches
between them but only remembers the last one configured.

**At the start of any session involving admin operations**,
verify the current connection before assuming it's correct.
Run `my-solution-admin health` (remote) or
`my-solution-admin users list` (local or remote) to confirm
which target the CLI is pointed at. Don't assume that after
a deploy or local MCP client configuration the admin CLI is
connected to that target — `connect` and `deploy` are
independent operations.

The admin CLI handles user registration, profile updates, token
issuance, revocation, deployment verification, and MCP client
registration for both local and remote instances. The
`mcp-app-admin` skill, if available, covers the full admin
workflow including signing key retrieval from deployment tooling.

**`users add` rejects existing users.** If the user already
exists, `add` fails with an error directing you to
`users update-profile`. This prevents accidental profile
overwrites — especially dangerous for API-proxy apps where the
profile contains backend credentials.

**`users update-profile`** updates individual profile fields
without replacing the entire profile. For apps with
`profile_expand=True`, the key argument is validated against
the Pydantic model's fields:

```bash
# Typed key (expand=True) — key is validated, tab-completable
my-solution-admin users update-profile alice@example.com token new-api-key

# JSON merge (expand=False or no profile model)
my-solution-admin users update-profile alice@example.com '{"token": "new-key"}'
```

Use `update-profile` to rotate backend credentials, refresh
OAuth tokens, or change any per-user setting without
re-registering the user.

### Environment variables

| Var | Required | If Missing | Purpose |
|-----|----------|------------|---------|
| `SIGNING_KEY` | For HTTP | Startup fails | JWT signing key |
| `JWT_AUD` | No | Audience not validated | Expected JWT `aud` claim |
| `APP_USERS_PATH` | No | `~/.local/share/{name}/users/` | Per-user data directory |
| `TOKEN_DURATION_SECONDS` | No | 315360000 (~10yr) | Token lifetime in seconds |

**`SIGNING_KEY`** — a secret. Never commit it to the repo, never
put it in a checked-in config file. Generate a strong random value:

```bash
python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))'
```

How the signing key gets into the environment depends on the
deployment tool. Work with the user to determine the right
approach for their setup. Common patterns:

- **CI/CD secrets** — e.g., GitHub Actions secrets injected as
  env vars during deployment
- **Cloud secret managers** — e.g., GCP Secret Manager, AWS
  Secrets Manager, mapped to the env var by the deployment tool
- **Deployment tool generated** — some tools (e.g., Terraform's
  `random_password`) can generate and manage the secret directly

The goal: the secret is stored safely and injected into the
`SIGNING_KEY` env var wherever the server runs. The agent should
guide the user through this for their specific deployment path.

**After deploy, you need the signing key back** to configure the
admin CLI for user management. The deployment tool that created
or stored the secret must provide a way to retrieve it. If you're
using a deployment skill, check whether it has a secrets get/read
command. For example, with gapp: `gapp_secret_get(env_var_name=
"SIGNING_KEY", plaintext=True)`. Without a deployment tool, read
the secret directly from wherever it was stored (cloud secret
manager, CI/CD secrets, etc.).

**`JWT_AUD`** — optional. If unset, audience is not validated and
any valid JWT signed with the same key is accepted. If multiple
apps share the same signing key but do not set `JWT_AUD` (or set
it to the same value), they will accept each other's user tokens.
This may be intentional (shared auth across a suite of apps) or
undesirable (cross-app token leakage). If each app has a unique
signing key, audience validation is less critical. Discuss with
the user and let them decide.

**`APP_USERS_PATH`** — critical for any deployment where the
filesystem is not persistent. The default (`~/.local/share/{name}/users/`)
works on a developer's laptop. In a container, this path is
ephemeral — the app starts, users get registered, tools execute,
and then user data is silently lost on container restart. No error,
no warning. For any persistent deployment, this must point to a
mounted volume or persistent storage path. Make the user aware of
this and confirm the path is durable before considering deployment
complete.

**`TOKEN_DURATION_SECONDS`** — defaults to ~10 years, which
effectively means tokens are permanent. If the user wants tokens
to expire sooner, set this. The value applies to newly issued
tokens only — existing tokens keep their original expiry.

## Testing and Validation

After building the solution, write tests and validate both transports.
This is not optional — do it before the compliance dashboard.

### Step 1: SDK unit tests

Test business logic directly. Set `current_user` and env vars
in fixtures — the SDK reads these at runtime:

```python
import os
import pytest
from mcp_app.context import current_user
from mcp_app.models import UserRecord

@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def isolated_env(tmp_path):
    os.environ["MY_SOLUTION_DATA"] = str(tmp_path / "data")
    os.environ["MY_SOLUTION_CONFIG"] = str(tmp_path / "config")
    token = current_user.set(UserRecord(email="test-user"))
    yield
    current_user.reset(token)
    del os.environ["MY_SOLUTION_DATA"]
    del os.environ["MY_SOLUTION_CONFIG"]

def test_saves_entry():
    sdk = MySDK()
    result = sdk.save_entry({"item": "apple"})
    assert result["success"]

def test_multi_user_isolation(tmp_path):
    """Data for different users doesn't mix."""
    token = current_user.set(UserRecord(email="alice@example.com"))
    try:
        sdk = MySDK()
        sdk.save_entry({"item": "apple"})
    finally:
        current_user.reset(token)

    token = current_user.set(UserRecord(email="bob@example.com"))
    try:
        sdk = MySDK()
        sdk.save_entry({"item": "banana"})
    finally:
        current_user.reset(token)
```

### Step 2: Full-stack HTTP validation

Validate the entire ASGI stack in-memory using httpx's ASGI
transport. No server process, no port, no Docker. httpx is a
dependency of mcp-app — the solution gets it for free.

**If it works here, it works in uvicorn, it works in Docker.**

```python
import httpx
import jwt as pyjwt
from datetime import datetime, timezone, timedelta
from mcp_app.bootstrap import build_app

@pytest.fixture
def app_client(tmp_path):
    os.environ["APP_USERS_PATH"] = str(tmp_path / "users")
    os.environ["SIGNING_KEY"] = "test-key"
    app, mcp, store, config = build_app()
    transport = httpx.ASGITransport(app=app)
    return httpx.AsyncClient(transport=transport, base_url="http://test")

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_register_and_call_tool(app_client):
    admin_token = pyjwt.encode(
        {"sub": "admin", "scope": "admin",
         "iat": datetime.now(timezone.utc),
         "exp": datetime.now(timezone.utc) + timedelta(minutes=5)},
        "test-key", algorithm="HS256",
    )
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {admin_token}"}

    resp = await app_client.post(
        "/admin/users",
        json={"email": "user@example.com",
              "profile": {"token": "test-api-key"}},
        headers=headers,
    )
    assert resp.status_code == 200
    assert "token" in resp.json()
```

### Step 3: stdio validation

```bash
claude mcp add my-solution -- my-solution-mcp stdio --user local
```

### Step 4: Run tests

```bash
pytest tests/unit/ -v
```

All tests must pass before the compliance dashboard.

### Step 5: mcp-app framework test suite

mcp-app ships reusable tests that check auth enforcement,
user admin, JWT handling, CLI wiring, tool protocol compliance,
and SDK test coverage — against YOUR app. These are the
authoritative verification that the app is correctly built on
the framework.

**Check if `tests/framework/` exists.** If it does, run it:

```bash
pytest tests/framework/ -v
```

If it passes, the app is verified. If it fails, investigate —
the failure is either a real compliance issue or an upstream
bug (check mcp-app's issue tracker).

**If `tests/framework/` does not exist, create it now:**

`tests/framework/conftest.py` — the only file that differs
per app (points at your `App` object):

```python
import pytest
from my_solution import app as my_app

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def app():
    return my_app
```

`tests/framework/test_framework.py` — identical across all
mcp-app solutions:

```python
from mcp_app.testing.iam import *
from mcp_app.testing.wiring import *
from mcp_app.testing.tools import *
from mcp_app.testing.health import *
```

Then run:

```bash
pytest tests/framework/ -v
```

Zero failures means: auth works, admin works, tools are wired,
identity is enforced, and the SDK has test coverage for every
tool.

**When to run these tests:**
- After adopting the framework test suite for the first time
- After upgrading mcp-app to a newer version
- After any migration or structural change
- As part of any compliance review

### When to stub

- **Network I/O** — stub HTTP clients, external API calls
- **Cloud CLIs** — mock at the SDK function boundary
- **Everything else** — real code, real files, real config

## Deployment

The solution is a standard Python app. It deploys as a container
or a process on any platform. This section describes what the app
needs from its environment — the runtime contract — and then
covers containerization and deployment routes.

### Running locally

**stdio** — no auth, no signing key. The MCP client launches the
process:
```bash
my-solution-mcp stdio --user local
```

**HTTP** — requires `SIGNING_KEY` at minimum:
```bash
SIGNING_KEY=your-key my-solution-mcp serve
```

With all options:
```bash
SIGNING_KEY=your-key \
APP_USERS_PATH=/data/my-solution/users \
JWT_AUD=my-solution \
TOKEN_DURATION_SECONDS=2592000 \
  my-solution-mcp serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

### Runtime contract

Any deployment target must provide:

- **Start command:** `my-solution-mcp serve` (optionally
  `--host` and `--port`, defaults to `0.0.0.0:8080`).
  This is a CLI command, not an importable ASGI module path.
  mcp-app does not expose a module-level ASGI app variable —
  it builds the ASGI app internally at startup. Deployment
  tools that distinguish between a raw command and an ASGI
  entrypoint must use the command form.
- **Environment variables:** see the environment variables
  section above — at minimum `SIGNING_KEY` (secret) and
  `APP_USERS_PATH` (persistent path) for any durable deployment
- **MCP endpoint path:** `/` (root). mcp-app serves the MCP
  SSE/streamable transport at the root path, not `/mcp`. MCP
  clients connect to `https://host:port/`, not
  `https://host:port/mcp`. If a previous deployment served at
  a different path, client URLs must be updated.
- **Health check:** `GET /health` — no auth required, returns
  `{"status": "ok"}`
- **Admin API:** `POST/GET /admin/users`, `DELETE /admin/users/{email}`,
  `PATCH /admin/users/{email}/profile`, `POST /admin/tokens` —
  all require admin auth via signing key
- **Auth model:** the app handles its own auth via JWT. If the
  platform has its own auth gate (e.g., IAM, API gateway), it
  must allow unauthenticated traffic through to the app
- **Build root:** the repo root where `pyproject.toml` lives

**Docker example:**
```bash
docker build -t my-solution .
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e SIGNING_KEY=your-key \
  -v /persistent/path:/data \
  -e APP_USERS_PATH=/data/users \
  my-solution
```

### Containerizing

If the deployment target needs a container image, add a
Dockerfile to the repo root:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install -e .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["my-solution-mcp", "serve"]
```

The build context is the repo root. `pip install -e .` installs
the solution package (which depends on mcp-app). The app listens
on port 8080 by default.

Some deployment tools (e.g., gapp, Cloud Build, Buildpacks)
generate or manage the Dockerfile for you. Check your tool's
documentation before writing one manually.

### Deployment routes

mcp-app does not prescribe a deployment tool. Common options:

- **Bare metal / VPS** — `pip install -e . && my-solution-mcp serve`
  with env vars set in the shell or a process manager
- **Docker** — build the image, run it with `-e SIGNING_KEY=...`
  and a volume mount for `APP_USERS_PATH`
- **Cloud Run / similar** — deploy from source or from a container
  image, set env vars and secrets through the platform
- **gapp** — if you're using the echomodel skill collection,
  there is a deploy skill that handles infrastructure, secrets,
  and data volumes for Cloud Run. Invoke it — it will guide
  through setup, secret configuration, and deployment using
  the runtime contract above.

When using a deployment skill, invoke it now. The runtime
contract, env var requirements, and auth model are already in
your context — map them to the deployment tool's configuration.
After deployment completes, continue below with post-deploy
verification and user management.

Regardless of route, the agent must ensure:
1. `SIGNING_KEY` is sourced from a secrets store or generated by
   the deployment tool — never hardcoded or checked in
2. `APP_USERS_PATH` points to persistent storage — not the
   container's ephemeral filesystem
3. The platform allows unauthenticated HTTP traffic through to
   the app (mcp-app handles auth internally)

### Post-deploy: admin setup, users, and verification

After deployment, the next steps are: retrieve the signing key
from the deployment environment, connect the admin CLI, register
users, verify the deployment end-to-end, and generate MCP client
registration commands. The `mcp-app-admin` skill, if available,
covers this workflow in detail — including how to trace the
signing key through various deployment tools (gapp, Terraform,
cloud secret managers, Docker, CI/CD secrets).

**Quick reference** (see `mcp-app-admin` for full guidance):

```bash
# Connect admin CLI (signing key from your deployment tool)
my-solution-admin connect https://your-service --signing-key xxx

# Probe: health + MCP tools round-trip in one command
my-solution-admin probe

# Register a user
my-solution-admin users add alice@example.com

# Generate MCP client registration commands (mints a token)
my-solution-admin register --user alice@example.com
```

`probe` confirms the deployment is serving tools end-to-end — not
just that the process is alive (`health`), but that the MCP layer
responds with the expected tools. Use it as the single verification
step after any deploy or redeploy.

`register` emits ready-to-paste commands for Claude Code, Gemini
CLI, and the Claude.ai URL form, with the URL and token already
substituted. Both commands support `--json` for structured output
when called from an agent.

## Documentation

The implementing app's README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md must be
self-sufficient. A user, operator, or agent landing on the repo
should be able to install, configure, run, deploy, verify,
administer, and contribute without having the `author-mcp-app`
or `mcp-app-admin` skills loaded and without being told to
install them. Assume the reader has none of the framework's
context in their head.

This is non-negotiable. The skills accelerate authoring and
operation when available, but an app whose docs only work when
paired with the skills is a broken app — most readers (human or
agent) will arrive without them.

### Default posture: deployment-agnostic, like mcp-app itself

mcp-app describes a runtime contract — env vars, start command,
endpoint paths, health and admin APIs — and leaves the
deployment tool or environment to map to it. Apps built on
mcp-app inherit that posture by default. The framework has
already given authors everything they need to stay
deployment-agnostic: an env-var-driven runtime, no hardcoded
paths, no platform-specific code, a standard Python package
that deploys wherever Python deploys.

In **greenfield authoring**, assume the user wants this. Docs
describe what the app needs from any environment. Show Docker
as a universal illustrative example if one is needed, but do
not prescribe a platform, a secret store, or a concrete path.
This lets the app be picked up and deployed by whoever needs
it without the docs arguing with their choice.

In **migrations and reviews**, check in-repo precedent before
assuming the default. If the repo has already committed to a
specific platform — platform-specific configs checked in,
deployment commands in the README, CI workflows that only
target one environment — the user may have deliberately coupled
the app to that platform. Don't force a refactor. Offer to
factor out the coupling if context suggests that's the user's
goal, or if they haven't considered the tradeoff, frame the
opportunity: "this app is currently coupled to X; making it
platform-agnostic would let anyone deploy it anywhere. Want to
refactor, or keep the coupling intentional?"

A user who is committed to a concrete platform expression —
because their org only uses one, because the app is meant for
a specific environment, because the coupling simplifies
something they care about — is making a valid choice. The
skill's job is to articulate the tradeoff, not overrule it.

### Where deployment config lives under the agnostic route

When an app stays deployment-agnostic, deployment decisions
and configuration live *separately* from the app repo — in
CI/CD workflows, ops repos, infrastructure-as-code modules,
or wherever environment-specific (but non-secret) settings,
build scripts, and deployment tooling belong. Help the user
see that the app repo stays focused on the app; their
deployment choices live wherever they normally manage that
concern. Agentic workflows operating on the deployment
environment will typically have additional skills or plugins
loaded for the deployment tooling, separate from this skill
and from the app itself.

Connective tissue between sessions is retained by the mcp-app
admin CLI's per-app `connect` config — URL + signing-key
access persisted under XDG config paths
(`~/.config/{app-name}/setup.json`), always outside the
solution app repo. That state can be managed and versioned by
a dotfile manager or lifted into a separate, private
operator-owned repo if durability beyond a single workstation
is needed. Either way, it stays external to the solution app
repo. When reviewing or authoring, never suggest persisting
deployment metadata inside the solution app repo just because
it might be convenient — that's how reusable products get
their portability quietly stolen.

### The compatibility-artifact middle ground

Between "fully agnostic" and "opinionated in-repo tooling" sits
a third valid posture: **agnostic for mcp-app deploy, with
minimal compatibility artifacts** for non-mcp-app tools.

A solution built on mcp-app is also a standard Python web
service. Shipping a tiny, platform-neutral artifact doesn't
commit the repo to a platform; it just makes the app consumable
by tools that need an entry-point hint. The artifacts that
matter:

- **`Procfile`** (one line): unlocks `gcloud run deploy
  --source .`, Heroku, Render, Fly, Railway, any Procfile-aware
  PaaS. Doesn't name any cloud vendor. Example:
  ```
  web: my-app-mcp serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
  ```
- **`Dockerfile`** (minimal, ~5 lines): unlocks local
  `docker build`, any container platform, CI-built images.
  Doesn't pick a cloud or a registry.

These are *additive*. `mcp-app deploy` (via `cloudrun` provider,
etc.) brings its own build template and ignores these artifacts.
Opinionated deploy tools (e.g., a shipped `.tf` module for one
specific platform) bring their own containerization and ignore
these artifacts. Bare `gcloud` / Heroku / etc. consume them.
Every downstream consumer is happy.

**When to suggest shipping these:** when the solution is
publicly reusable and the author wants to minimize friction for
any would-be deployer. When authors say "I want this to work
with just `gcloud run deploy --source .`" — ship a `Procfile`.

**When to skip:** stdio-only apps; truly internal apps with a
single committed deploy path; apps where the author wants to
force `mcp-app deploy` as the only path.

### The opinionated-tooling alternative — when and when not

A secondary route is to ship opinionated build and deployment
tooling *inside* the app repo: Dockerfiles beyond a minimal
illustration, CI workflow templates, Terraform modules
(`.tf` files) or other infrastructure-as-code, platform-specific
manifests, or configs for a particular deployment tool. Done
well, this tooling remains *operator-agnostic* — environment
specifics (project IDs, secret names, domains) and secrets
stay out of the repo; the configs describe how to build and
deploy without dictating where.

When to suggest or accept this route:

- The app is **internal, personal, or has a narrow audience**
  where authors and operators are closely aligned and the
  convenience outweighs the portability loss
- The user explicitly wants an opinionated path for themselves
  or a small team
- An in-repo precedent already exists and the user wants to
  extend it

When to push back or recommend against it:

- The app is being published as a **reusable public product**
  aimed at broad adoption — every in-repo tooling assumption
  is one more thing a would-be user has to agree with or work
  around
- The user hasn't considered the tradeoff and the repo's goal
  implies broad reuse (public visibility, generic naming,
  "framework"/"library"/"solution" framing)

When in doubt, frame the tradeoff plainly: in-repo opinionated
tooling is a convenience for aligned operators and a tax on
everyone else. Public reusable products usually skip it or
keep only a minimal Docker example. Private/internal apps may
reasonably include more.

### What the app's docs must cover — the six user journeys

The User Journey Map section above enumerates the six journeys
every mcp-app solution supports. The implementing app's docs
must walk readers through each journey in app-specific terms —
substituting the app's real CLI names, profile fields, env var
values, and deployment target. This skill is the source for
what each journey requires; the preceding sections (User
Identity and Profile, Environment variables, User management,
Deployment, Post-deploy) are the raw material to distill from.

**1. Understand the app (README opener — why it exists)**

One paragraph: what problem does this app solve, and who is it
for. Name the backend system if it's an API-proxy (e.g., "wraps
the Example.com API"). Name the data domain if it's data-owning
(e.g., "tracks daily food logs"). Be concrete — an agent reading
this must be able to decide in three sentences whether the tool
is what it needs. Defer "how" to later sections.

**2. Install and run locally (stdio journey)**

For users who want to run the tool on their own machine:

- How to `pipx install` (or `pip install`) the app
- How to register with MCP clients for stdio
  (`claude mcp add`, `gemini mcp add`, full command)
- Whether stdio mode needs per-user credentials and how to
  provide them (if the app has a profile model, describe
  how to set profile data for the `local` user — typically
  via `my-app-admin connect local` then `users add local`
  or `users update-profile local`)
- Smoke-test command or example tool invocation

If the app is HTTP-only (no stdio), say so at the top of this
section and point to the remote journey instead.

**3. Deploy (HTTP journey for operators)**

An mcp-app HTTP solution can deploy through multiple tools in
parallel. Documentation lists the paths the solution supports
as peers, without elevating one over the others.

Start with the runtime contract, scoped to this app — what it
needs from any environment. This applies to every deploy path:

- Required env vars the app reads
  (`SIGNING_KEY` always; `APP_USERS_PATH` pointing to
  persistent storage; any app-specific env vars for data,
  config, or cache paths). Name the variables and what they
  mean. Don't prescribe concrete values that only make sense
  in one environment.
- Start command (`my-app-mcp serve`, optional
  `--host`/`--port`)
- Endpoint path (`/`, not `/mcp`), health path
  (`/health`), admin path (`/admin`)
- Auth model: the app handles its own JWT auth; the
  platform must allow unauthenticated HTTP through to the
  app

Then document each supported deploy path as a peer
subsection. Common options:

- `mcp-app deploy` (once a provider for the target platform
  exists)
- `gcloud run deploy --source .` (if a `Procfile` ships)
- `docker build .` (if a `Dockerfile` ships)
- Any opinionated deploy tool the author has committed to

**No deploy path is canonical unless the author explicitly
chooses one.** Every supported path gets first-class treatment
with its own section, its own runnable commands, its own
post-deploy verification notes. Use Docker as a universal
illustrative example if one is helpful — a standard multi-stage
Dockerfile reaches every container platform.

If in-repo precedent shows the user has committed to a
specific platform (platform-specific configs checked in,
deployment tool already wired up, CI targeting one
environment), document that concretely as the primary path —
this is the user's choice and the docs should match. If the
repo shows no such commitment, stay agnostic and let the
reader's environment drive.

If the app's deployment is commonly paired with a specific
tool that has its own skill (e.g., gapp), mention the tool
by name and link to it, but don't assume the reader has
that skill loaded — link to the tool's own README or walk
through the manual steps.

**4. Connect the admin CLI (operator journey — post-deploy)**

This is the section most frequently neglected and most
valuable. A reader returning to the app months later to rotate
a token must be able to re-discover the admin workflow from
this section alone:

- `my-app-admin connect local` vs
  `my-app-admin connect <url> --signing-key xxx`
- How to retrieve the signing key — describe the mechanism,
  not a location. "The signing key is wherever your
  deployment put `SIGNING_KEY` — trace it back through your
  deployment tooling (cloud secret manager, CI secret store,
  deployment tool's secret command, etc.)." Name a concrete
  retrieval path only if the repo has committed to a
  specific deployment.
- What "local" means for this app and when to use it
- The fact that `connect` persists config in
  `~/.config/{app-name}/setup.json` — subsequent admin
  commands don't repeat `--url` or `--signing-key`
- A reminder that `connect` and deploy are independent —
  deploying doesn't auto-connect the admin CLI

**5. Manage users and credentials (admin journey)**

Concrete commands for this app's profile shape:

- `users add` with this app's actual profile flags
  (`--token`, `--api-key`, whatever the Pydantic model
  declares). Show a real-looking invocation.
- How to discover profile fields from the CLI itself
  (`users add --help`) — this is the self-documentation
  path for agents operating the app
- `users update-profile` to rotate a specific credential
  without re-registering
- `users list`, `users revoke`, `tokens create`
- Where to obtain the backend credential for this app's
  profile fields (the URL users visit to generate an API
  token, the OAuth flow, etc.). This belongs in the docs
  AND in the `Field(description=...)` on the profile
  model. Both exist for different audiences — CLI help
  for operators mid-task, README for operators onboarding.

**6. Verify end-to-end and register MCP clients**

- `my-app-admin probe` — what it checks and what good
  output looks like
- `my-app-admin register --user <email>` — generates
  ready-to-paste commands for Claude Code, Gemini CLI,
  Claude.ai URL form
- Manual MCP client config as fallback (claude/gemini
  `mcp add` commands with HTTP transport, header-based
  auth, the `${VAR}` env expansion pattern that both
  clients support for keeping tokens out of config files)

### Principles for distilling, not copying

**App-specific over generic for things the app owns.**
Framework-level prose uses placeholders like `my-app-admin`
and `do_thing`. The implementing app's README uses the real
CLI name, real tool names, real profile field names. Substitute
throughout so every command is copy-pasteable verbatim. This is
always correct — it costs nothing and the app owns these names
regardless of where it's deployed.

**Agnostic over concrete for things the deployment owns.** The
app doesn't own `APP_USERS_PATH`'s value, secret storage
location, the platform, or orchestration details. Those are
environment concerns. Describe what the app needs from the
environment — not a prescribed value — unless the repo has
deliberately committed to a specific platform. "Set
`APP_USERS_PATH` to persistent storage" is the app's language;
"set it to `/data/my-app/users` mounted from a Cloud Run
volume" is the deployment's language, which only belongs in
the README if the app is explicitly coupled to that deployment.

**This app's shape, not the framework's shape.** If the app has
no profile model (data-owning), don't document profile flags or
profile update commands — they're irrelevant. If the app is
stdio-only, don't document HTTP deployment. Show only the
journeys that apply.

**Match the mcp-app framework, don't extend it.** Don't document
env vars, endpoint paths, admin commands, or behaviors the
framework doesn't actually provide. If the app needs something
extra (a custom env var, an app-specific CLI subcommand),
document it as an app-level addition, distinct from framework
behavior. When the framework changes, only the framework-level
paragraphs need updating across the fleet.

**No references to skills as prerequisites.** Never write "see
the author-mcp-app skill" or "run /mcp-app-admin" as the primary
instruction for any step. The skills are an accelerant, not a
prerequisite. A pointer to them belongs in a footer section
(see below), and even then only as an optional optimization.

**No "why we chose mcp-app" explanations.** The framework
justifies itself in its own README. The implementing app's
README is about using THIS app, not marketing the framework.
Mention the framework once in passing ("built on
[mcp-app](https://github.com/echomodel/mcp-app)") and move on.

**No bridges, no legacy callouts.** Don't document "we used to
do X, now we do Y" unless there's an active migration the
reader needs to navigate. Coherent product, not history exposé.

### README.md structure — recommended skeleton

```markdown
# my-app

<one-paragraph: what it does, who it's for>

## Install

<pipx or pip install commands, any system prereqs>

## Run locally (stdio)

<claude mcp add / gemini mcp add commands>
<profile setup for the local user if applicable>

## Deploy

<env var table — SIGNING_KEY, APP_USERS_PATH, app-specific>
<runtime contract: start command, ports, endpoint paths,
 auth model>
<Docker example as universal illustration — or, if the repo
 is deliberately platform-coupled, the concrete deployment
 route for that platform>
<post-deploy: connect admin CLI, how to trace the signing
 key back through whatever deployment tooling was used>

## Manage users

<users add with this app's actual flags>
<users update-profile, users list, users revoke, tokens create>
<where to obtain backend credentials if API-proxy>

## Verify and register MCP clients

<probe>
<register command output with real-looking URLs>
<manual MCP client config as fallback>

## Configuration

<env var reference table>
<XDG paths this app uses>

## For agents: optional skill accelerants

If you're a coding agent with plugin support, the
[author-mcp-app](...) and [mcp-app-admin](...) skills provide
step-by-step workflows for authoring and operating apps on
this framework. They are optional — this README is
self-sufficient.
```

The footer skill mention is the only place skills appear. It's
a footnote, not a dependency.

### CONTRIBUTING.md — architecture and maintenance

Covers what a contributor needs to change the app without
breaking compliance:

- Three-layer architecture (SDK / MCP / optional CLI) and
  the rule that business logic lives in the SDK
- Profile model location and the requirement that every
  profile field include `Field(description=...)` — this is
  the re-discovery mechanism for operators
- How to add an MCP tool (add an async function to the
  tools module — no decorators, no registration)
- How to add a profile field (update the Pydantic model,
  update `Field(description=...)`, update README's user
  management section, add or extend tests that cover
  profile handling)
- How to run the test suites — SDK unit tests and the
  mcp-app framework test suite (`pytest tests/framework/`)
- Environment variable conventions and how to add
  app-specific XDG paths
- Where deployment configuration lives and what owns it
  (the deployment tool vs. the app)
- Any app-specific design decisions that future
  contributors need to know (stored profile fields,
  refresh behavior, custom middleware if any)

Do not repeat the README. CONTRIBUTING is for contributors;
README is for users and operators. A link from CONTRIBUTING
back to README for "how users interact with this app" is
fine — duplication isn't.

### Patterns observed across existing mcp-app solutions

Use these as a reference when drafting — they're conventions
that have emerged across multiple apps built on this framework:

- **One-paragraph opener** that names the backend system
  (for API-proxy) or the data domain (for data-owning) in
  the first sentence. Skip preamble.
- **Env var table early** — a single table of every env
  var the app reads, with `Required | If Missing | Purpose`
  columns. This is where operators land when debugging
  startup failures.
- **Configure/install/register as three distinct sections.**
  Install = getting the package. Configure = env vars,
  signing key, profile data. Register = wiring into an MCP
  client. Conflating these confuses readers.
- **Concrete example tool call** in the Run Locally
  section — a literal tool invocation through an MCP
  client or a curl against the HTTP endpoint. Gives the
  reader confidence the thing is actually working.
- **Post-deploy verification section** — not "how to
  deploy" and not "how to manage users" but a distinct
  "how to confirm the deploy worked" section featuring
  `probe`. This is the first step a returning operator
  takes months later.
- **Rotating credentials as a named subsection** under
  user management. The token-rotation path is the single
  most-searched workflow after initial setup. Give it a
  heading.
- **MCP client config shown for all three clients**
  (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Claude.ai URL). Don't make
  the reader figure out which subset their client
  supports.

### Agent context files

**CLAUDE.md:**
```markdown
@README.md
@CONTRIBUTING.md
```

**`.gemini/settings.json`:**
```json
{
  "context": {
    "fileName": ["README.md", "CONTRIBUTING.md"]
  }
}
```

These files make the README and CONTRIBUTING content
automatically available to Claude Code and Gemini CLI when
they operate in the repo — a user or agent working in the
repo has the full operational context without needing to
load any skill.

### Agent context setup

If the app is being onboarded for AI-assisted development for
the first time — or if `CLAUDE.md`, `.gemini/settings.json`,
and `.gitignore` aren't yet set up correctly — the broader
goal is: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and any other agent that
opens the repo should automatically load README and
CONTRIBUTING, not leak agent-specific scratch files into the
repo, and share configuration that's universally useful
across tools.

The minimum:
- `CLAUDE.md` imports `@README.md` and `@CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `.gemini/settings.json` declares `README.md` and
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` as context files
- `.gitignore` ignores `.claude/` entirely and everything
  under `.gemini/` except `settings.json`

If the `setup-agent-context` skill is available in the
environment, it automates and standardizes this across repos.
Use it if present. If not, the minimum above is sufficient —
the skill exists to save time, not to add capability the
plain files lack.

## Compliance Dashboard

After all testing and validation steps are complete (including
the framework test suite from Step 5), present the dashboard:

```
## Solution Compliance Dashboard: {APP_NAME}

| Category | Item | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| Structure | SDK layer contains all business logic | ✅ |
| Structure | MCP tools are thin wrappers | ✅ |
| MCP | App object declared | ✅ |
| Identity | current_user accessible, profile typed | ✅ |
| CLI | Entry points for mcp + admin | ✅ |
| Testing | SDK unit tests pass | ✅ |
| Testing | mcp-app test suite passes | ✅ |
| Testing | stdio validated | ✅ |
| Deploy | Runtime contract documented (Docker example or equivalent) | ❌ |

✅ = conforms  ❌ = missing/wrong  ⚠️ = partial
```

**The solution is ready when `pytest tests/` passes with zero
failures.** The mcp-app test suite is the authoritative check —
if it passes, auth works, admin works, tools are wired, identity
is enforced, and the SDK has test coverage for every tool.

After presenting the dashboard:

1. If there are ❌ or ⚠️ items: "Want me to fix these?"
2. If all ✅: "This solution is ready for deployment."
