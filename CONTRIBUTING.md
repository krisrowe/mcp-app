## Architectural Decisions

### Agent-composed over provider-coupled (admin tools)

The original design proposed a provider plugin system where mcp-app internally
discovers deployment backends. This was rejected in favor of stateless admin
tools that the AI agent orchestrates externally.

**Reasoning:**
- The agent IS the orchestrator — building a second integration layer in code
  adds coupling for no benefit
- MCP's design intent: tools are stateless, self-describing, composed by the
  caller
- Unix philosophy: small tools, agent-composed. Neither mcp-app nor deployment
  tools know about each other
- The deploy→verify→manage workflow happens naturally when agents call tools
  in sequence

**What this means in practice:**
- AdminClient is stateless — takes a URL and signing key, makes REST calls
- MCP admin tools take `base_url` and `signing_key` as explicit parameters
- No internal references to gapp, Cloud Run, or any deployment tool
- The admin tools don't know how the service was deployed or where the signing
  key came from

### cwd is never used for deploy or admin

`mcp-app serve` and `mcp-app build` read `mcp-app.yaml` from the current
directory — you're the solution developer working in your repo.

All other commands ignore the current directory entirely. Deploy reads from
fleet source refs. Admin commands talk to a remote URL. The operator's cwd
is irrelevant and must never influence behavior. This is a hard rule, not
a default.

### Config vs problem-domain resources

`config` subcommands are for tool preferences (output format, storage backend,
keychain settings). Problem-domain resources (fleets, users, tokens) get their
own top-level command groups with CRUD operations. Never mix them.

**Test:** "If I deleted this, would I lose work or just a preference?"
- Preference → `config`
- Managed resource → its own command group

### Signing key storage

The fleetless admin path needs to persist a signing key locally.

- **Default:** OS keychain via `keyring` library (macOS Keychain, Windows
  Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service). Zero config on desktop platforms.
- **Fallback:** file-based storage in XDG config dir, chosen explicitly via
  `mcp-app config signing-key-store file`. Never a silent fallback — fail
  with an actionable hint if keychain is unavailable.
- **Escape hatch:** `MCP_APP_SIGNING_KEY` env var or `--signing-key` flag
  always work.
- **Fleet mode:** the deploy provider resolves the signing key from the cloud's
  secret store on demand. Nothing stored locally.

Note: current code writes to `active.json` in plaintext. This should migrate
to keychain-first once `keyring` is added as a dependency.

### Separate fleets over local override files

An earlier design used a gitignored `.fleet.local.yaml` that extended the
shared fleet manifest with local-only solutions. This was rejected because
any mechanism that layers config on top of shared state risks mutating it —
even "additive" changes to existing objects can be destructive (changing a
region, adding a config field that alters provider behavior, overriding a
secret reference).

Separate fleets eliminate this entirely. Each fleet is self-contained. Want
local docker instances? Put them in a `local` fleet. Shared Cloud Run
services? They're in `work`. They never mix, merge, or conflict.

## What mcp-app Is

A config-driven framework for building and running MCP servers as HTTP
services (and eventually stdio). Solutions define tools as pure Python
functions. The framework handles everything else: FastMCP setup, tool
discovery, middleware, auth, admin endpoints, data stores, and serving.

### Core principle: zero framework imports in tool code

Tools are plain async functions. Docstrings become MCP tool descriptions.
Type hints become tool schemas. No `@mcp.tool()` decorators. The framework
discovers and registers tools automatically from the module declared in
`mcp-app.yaml`.

How this works: `bootstrap.py` imports the tools module, finds all public
async functions via `inspect`, and calls `mcp.tool()(func)` on each one.
The decorator still runs — mcp-app just calls it for you so your tools
module has no framework coupling.

### What mcp-app provides

- `mcp-app.yaml` config format and parser
- `mcp-app serve` CLI (HTTP mode)
- `mcp-app stdio` CLI (local mode — not yet implemented, see below)
- Tool discovery from module path (public async functions)
- Store abstraction (`filesystem` built-in, custom via module path)
- Middleware stack (`user-identity` built-in, credential proxy aliases
  planned, custom via module path)
- Admin REST endpoints at `/admin` (register, list, revoke users, issue
  tokens)
- `current_user_id` ContextVar (set by middleware, read by SDK)
- `UserAuthStore` protocol
- `UserDataStore` protocol + `FileSystemUserDataStore`
- `DataStoreAuthAdapter` bridge
- `JWTVerifier`
- `AdminClient` — stateless REST client for deployed instances
- MCP admin tools server (`mcp-app admin-tools`)

### What mcp-app does NOT provide

- Deployment (gapp or any container platform handles this)
- CLI scaffolding (solutions use Click directly)
- SDK scaffolding (solutions write their own)
- Dockerfile generation (gapp handles this)

## Two Transports: HTTP and stdio

A solution built with mcp-app works over both transports without code
changes. Same yaml, same tools module, same SDK.

### HTTP mode (`mcp-app serve`) — implemented

The full production stack:
- FastMCP wrapped with configured middleware (auth)
- Admin REST endpoints at `/admin`
- `current_user_id` set by middleware from JWT claims
- uvicorn runs internally (port 8080 by default)
- Store wired and accessible via `get_store()`

### stdio mode (`mcp-app stdio`) — not yet implemented

Local single-user mode:
- FastMCP runs over stdin/stdout
- No middleware, no admin endpoints, no ASGI layer
- `current_user_id` set from yaml config (not JWT — no auth in stdio)
- Store still wired — `get_store()` works the same way
- Tool discovery identical to HTTP — same module, same functions

**Why mcp-app matters for stdio:** Without it, solutions that want stdio
must use FastMCP directly with `@mcp.tool()` decorators and manual setup.
With `mcp-app stdio`, the same yaml-driven tool discovery works for both
transports. One build, two commands.

**When raw FastMCP is fine for stdio:** If the solution is stdio-only, has
no store, no identity concerns, and no plans for HTTP — raw FastMCP with
decorators is simpler. mcp-app adds value when the solution needs both
transports or uses the store/identity infrastructure.

### stdio identity

Identity in stdio mode must be deliberate, not a silent default. The
`stdio.identity` config in `mcp-app.yaml` determines how `current_user_id`
is set:

```yaml
stdio:
  identity:
    provider: static    # or "env", "config", or a module path
    user: "local"
```

If `stdio.identity` is not configured and `mcp-app stdio` is invoked,
mcp-app refuses to start with a clear error. No silent defaults.

See echomodel/mcp-app#4 for the full design and acceptance criteria.

### Solution entry points

Solutions declare a console script that invokes `mcp-app stdio`:

```toml
[project.scripts]
my-solution-mcp = "my_solution.cli:run_stdio"
```

Users register with: `claude mcp add my-solution -- my-solution-mcp`

## Tool Discovery

The `tools` field in `mcp-app.yaml` is a Python module path. At startup,
mcp-app imports that module and registers every public async function as
an MCP tool:

```python
# my_solution/mcp/tools.py
from my_solution.sdk.core import MySDK

sdk = MySDK()

async def do_thing(param: str) -> dict:
    """Do the thing for the current user."""
    return sdk.do_thing(param)
```

- Function name → tool name (`do_thing`)
- Docstring → tool description shown to agents
- Type hints → input schema
- Functions starting with `_` are skipped
- Sync functions are skipped (only async)

This is the mechanism that eliminates `@mcp.tool()` decorators. The
decorator still runs internally — `bootstrap.py` calls `mcp.tool()(func)`
for each discovered function.

## mcp-app.yaml Reference

```yaml
name: my-solution           # Required — server name, store paths
tools: my_solution.mcp.tools  # Required — module path for tool discovery
store: filesystem            # Optional — default: filesystem
middleware:                  # Optional — omit for no auth
  - user-identity
```

| Field | Required | Default | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| `name` | Yes | — | MCP server name, data store paths, XDG directory naming |
| `tools` | Yes | — | Python module path. All public async functions become tools. |
| `store` | No | `filesystem` | Data store backend. `filesystem` = per-user JSON under XDG. Dotted module path = custom backend. |
| `middleware` | No | none | Array of middleware aliases or module paths. |

### Resolution rules

- No dot in value → built-in alias (`filesystem`, `user-identity`,
  `bearer-proxy`, etc.)
- Dot in value → Python module path, dynamically imported

This applies to `store`, `middleware` entries, and stdio identity providers.

## Middleware Architecture

Middleware is an ordered pipeline of ASGI wrappers. Each entry in the
`middleware` array wraps the next (first = outermost). All middleware
shares a uniform constructor signature:

```python
def __init__(self, app, verifier: JWTVerifier, store=None)
```

The `store` parameter exists so credential proxy middleware can access
per-user credentials. `UserIdentityMiddleware` accepts it but doesn't
use it.

### Built-in middleware

| Alias | Class | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `user-identity` | `UserIdentityMiddleware` | Data-owning apps. Validates JWT, sets `current_user_id` ContextVar. Request passes through unchanged. |

### Planned middleware (echomodel/mcp-app#8)

| Alias | Class | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `bearer-proxy` | `BearerProxyMiddleware` | API-proxy apps with static tokens. Validates JWT, looks up stored backend token, rewrites Authorization header. |
| `google-oauth2-proxy` | `GoogleOAuth2ProxyMiddleware` | API-proxy apps wrapping Google APIs. Same as bearer-proxy but refreshes expired OAuth2 access tokens. |

`bearer-proxy` and `google-oauth2-proxy` share a `CredentialProxyMiddleware`
base class. The base handles JWT validation, credential lookup from the
store, and header rewriting. Subclasses implement strategy-specific token
resolution.

### Custom middleware

Any ASGI middleware class with the uniform signature works:

```yaml
middleware:
  - my_app.auth.MyCustomMiddleware
```

### Two app patterns

**Data-owning** (the solution owns user data — food logs, notes, etc.):
```yaml
middleware:
  - user-identity
```
Middleware validates JWT and sets `current_user_id`. The SDK reads it to
scope data per user. The request passes through unchanged.

**API-proxy** (the solution wraps an external API — financial data, task
management, Google Workspace, etc.):
```yaml
middleware:
  - bearer-proxy          # or google-oauth2-proxy
```
Middleware validates JWT, looks up the user's stored backend credential,
resolves an access token (passthrough for bearer, refresh for OAuth2),
and rewrites the Authorization header. The SDK receives a valid backend
API token and doesn't know about JWTs or user management.

These are explicit peers. Neither is a default. Omitting middleware
entirely means no auth — valid for internal services or stdio-only tools.

### Why three aliases instead of one configurable middleware

The strategy is an app-level decision, not a per-user decision. Every user
of a given app uses the same kind of credential for the same backend API.
Separate aliases mean:

- The admin doesn't specify strategy at registration time — the app already
  knows
- The middleware list stays a flat list of strings — no nested config
- Each alias is self-describing in the yaml
- Validation happens at startup (bad alias = immediate error, not a runtime
  surprise)

### Why pure ASGI middleware, not FastMCP's built-in auth

FastMCP provides `TokenVerifier`, `BearerAuthBackend`, and `ctx.client_id`.
We rejected these because:

- It couples the framework to FastMCP — mcp-app should work with any ASGI
  app
- `ctx.client_id` is only available inside MCP tool functions, not in the
  SDK layer
- The SDK would need to import FastMCP or bridge from `ctx.client_id` to a
  ContextVar per tool function

Pure ASGI middleware owns the ContextVar and sets it before any app code
runs. The SDK reads it. No bridging. No FastMCP imports in the SDK.

### Why `user-identity` and credential proxies are explicit peers

Earlier designs had JWT middleware as a hidden default. This was wrong — it
gave the impression that auth happens automatically. Both patterns serve
different app architectures and must be explicit choices in the yaml.

## Store Architecture

### UserDataStore protocol

Generic per-user JSON storage: `load(user, key)`, `save(user, key, data)`,
`list_users()`, `delete(user, key)`.

### UserAuthStore protocol

What the auth framework needs: `get(email)`, `list()`, `save(record)`,
`delete(email)`. Operates on `UserAuthRecord` (email, created,
revoke_after).

### DataStoreAuthAdapter

Bridges `UserDataStore` → `UserAuthStore`. Auth records stored under key
`"auth"`. This lets filesystem-based apps use one store for both auth
records and app data.

### Why two protocols

Auth doesn't know about app data. A MySQL app can implement
`UserAuthStore` against its customers table without ever using
`UserDataStore`. The bridge is optional convenience for simple filesystem
apps.

## Relationship to Other Packages

### gapp (deployment)

gapp deploys containers. It doesn't know about mcp-app's internals. If a
repo has `mcp-app.yaml`, gapp auto-detects it and generates a Dockerfile
with `CMD ["mcp-app", "serve"]`. No `service.entrypoint` needed.

mcp-app doesn't know about gapp either. Solutions deploy anywhere as
standard container images. gapp is one option — any container platform
works.

### app-user (superseded)

`app-user` was the original standalone auth library. mcp-app absorbed all
its code directly. The packages are byte-for-byte identical (different
import paths). `app-user` is effectively dead and should be archived.

Solutions should use `from mcp_app import ...` not `from app_user import
...`.

### gapp_run (legacy)

`gapp_run` is gapp's ASGI runtime wrapper that handles credential
mediation for API-proxy solutions. It's legacy — the credential mediation
code is being migrated into mcp-app as `bearer-proxy` and
`google-oauth2-proxy` middleware (echomodel/mcp-app#8). Once complete,
`gapp_run` reduces to health checks and dynamic app loading.

## SDK-First Architecture

All business logic lives in the core layer, not in CLI or MCP wrappers.

- `admin_client.py` — AdminClient SDK, REST client for deployed instances
- `cli.py` — thin Click wrapper, calls SDK, formats output
- `admin_tools.py` — thin MCP wrapper, calls SDK, handles tool schema

If you're writing logic in a CLI command or MCP tool handler, stop and move
it to the SDK.

## Testing and Local Validation

### The pattern: httpx ASGI transport

mcp-app and solutions built on it validate locally without running a
server, without Docker, and without any cloud dependencies. The key is
httpx's ASGI transport — it runs the full ASGI app in-memory:

```python
from mcp_app.bootstrap import build_app
import httpx

app, mcp, store, config = build_app()
transport = httpx.ASGITransport(app=app)
client = httpx.AsyncClient(transport=transport, base_url="http://test")
```

`build_app()` reads `mcp-app.yaml` and returns the complete ASGI app —
same object that `mcp-app serve` gives to uvicorn. Giving it to httpx
instead means the full stack runs in-process: tool discovery, middleware,
admin endpoints, store wiring. No server process, no port binding, no
cleanup.

**If it works in httpx ASGI transport, it works in uvicorn, it works in
Docker.** The ASGI app is the app. Transport is just how bytes get in
and out.

httpx is already a direct dependency of mcp-app (used by AdminClient),
so solutions get it for free. No extra dependencies to write tests.

### What to test in solutions

Solutions should validate their tools and auth flow locally:

```python
import os
import pytest
import httpx
from mcp_app.bootstrap import build_app

@pytest.fixture
def app_client(tmp_path):
    """Build the full ASGI app and return an httpx client."""
    os.environ["APP_USERS_PATH"] = str(tmp_path / "users")
    os.environ["SIGNING_KEY"] = "test-key"
    app, mcp, store, config = build_app()
    transport = httpx.ASGITransport(app=app)
    return httpx.AsyncClient(transport=transport, base_url="http://test")

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_admin_register_and_list(app_client):
    """Register a user via admin API, verify they appear in list."""
    # Mint an admin token
    import jwt as pyjwt
    from datetime import datetime, timezone, timedelta
    admin_token = pyjwt.encode(
        {"sub": "admin", "scope": "admin",
         "iat": datetime.now(timezone.utc),
         "exp": datetime.now(timezone.utc) + timedelta(minutes=5)},
        "test-key", algorithm="HS256",
    )
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {admin_token}"}

    # Register
    resp = await app_client.post(
        "/admin/users",
        json={"email": "user@example.com"},
        headers=headers,
    )
    assert resp.status_code == 200
    data = resp.json()
    assert "token" in data

    # List
    resp = await app_client.get("/admin/users", headers=headers)
    assert resp.status_code == 200
    users = resp.json()
    assert any(u["email"] == "user@example.com" for u in users)
```

This tests the full stack: yaml config → tool discovery → middleware →
admin endpoints → store → filesystem. Same code path as production.

### mcp-app's own tests

mcp-app uses the same pattern internally:

```python
transport = httpx.ASGITransport(app=starlette_app)
http_client = httpx.AsyncClient(transport=transport, base_url="http://test")
client = AdminClient("http://test", signing_key, http_client=http_client)
```

AdminClient → httpx → ASGI → Starlette → admin.py → FileSystemUserDataStore → tmp_path.

### stdio validation

For stdio, register with an MCP client directly:

```bash
claude mcp add my-solution -- mcp-app stdio
```

Claude Code launches the process and manages its lifecycle. No background
server, no port management, no cleanup. Call tools through the agent.

Note: `mcp-app stdio` is not yet implemented (echomodel/mcp-app#4). Until
then, solutions can use FastMCP directly for stdio validation:

```python
# my_solution/__main__.py
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
mcp = FastMCP("my-solution")
# register tools manually with @mcp.tool() for stdio path
mcp.run()
```

### What httpx ASGI transport validates

Everything that matters for deployment readiness:
- Tool discovery from `mcp-app.yaml`
- Middleware auth (JWT validation, user identity)
- Admin endpoints (user registration, listing, tokens)
- Store wiring (per-user data, auth records)
- SDK business logic (your actual tools)

What it doesn't test (and doesn't need to):
- Port binding (trivial, uvicorn handles it)
- DNS/networking (transport plumbing, not app logic)
- Container startup (Dockerfile concern, not app concern)

## Dependencies

httpx is a direct dependency (used by AdminClient). It is also the #2 Python
HTTP client by downloads (~500M/month), maintained by Encode (author of Django
REST Framework and Starlette), and a hard dependency of every major AI SDK
(OpenAI, Anthropic, Google GenAI). It was already a transitive dependency via
starlette and mcp.
