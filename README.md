# mcp-app

Framework for building and running MCP servers as HTTP services.
Define tools as pure Python functions, wire up with two lines, run
with one command.

## Why mcp-app

FastMCP is great for quickly spinning up a local tool. But as soon
as you want to productize it, share it with others, or use it across
multiple identities, you end up building auth, user management, admin
endpoints, and deployment config into each app. They all invariably
get done a little differently.

When you're moving at the speed of agents — building and releasing
impactful tools quickly — you need them to be consistent and secure
without repeating boilerplate into each one and trying to manage all
the implementations. You want to scale impact instead of adding to
the cognitive load needed to keep deploying and trusting you'll be
able to come back and refresh a token or add a user months later.

mcp-app gives you:

- **Identity enforced by default.** JWT auth runs automatically.
  Tools can't execute without an established user. You can't
  accidentally ship a wide-open service.
- **User management built in.** Admin endpoints, CLI for local and
  remote user management, typed profile per user — identical across
  every app.
- **Both transports, same code.** `serve` (HTTP) and `stdio`
  (local) from one `App` object.
- **Free tests for your app.** `mcp_app.testing` checks auth,
  admin, wiring, and tool coverage against your specific app.
  Import the tests, run pytest, confirm everything works.
- **Deployment-ready.** Container, bare metal, Cloud Run, or gapp.

The consistency is the point. User management, token rotation, auth
enforcement, admin CLI — these work the same way across all your
solutions. Learn it once, the tests confirm it works, and when you
need to update a token or revoke a user six months later, the
workflow is the same regardless of which app you're touching.

## Install

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/echomodel/mcp-app.git
```

## Quick Start

Create your tools module — pure async functions, no framework imports:

```python
# my_app/mcp/tools.py
from my_app.sdk.core import MySDK

sdk = MySDK()

async def do_thing(param: str) -> dict:
    """Tool description shown to agents."""
    return sdk.do_thing(param)
```

Wire up in `__init__.py`:

```python
# my_app/__init__.py
from mcp_app.cli import create_mcp_cli, create_admin_cli

mcp_cli = create_mcp_cli("my-app")
admin_cli = create_admin_cli("my-app")
```

Add entry points to `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.scripts]
my-app-mcp = "my_app:mcp_cli"
my-app-admin = "my_app:admin_cli"
```

Run:

```bash
my-app-mcp serve                   # HTTP, multi-user
my-app-mcp stdio --user local      # stdio, single user
```

No config files. Tool discovery, identity middleware, admin endpoints,
and store wiring are handled by the framework from the Python args.

### Store

Default store is filesystem — per-user directories under
`~/.local/share/{name}/users/`. Override with `APP_USERS_PATH`
env var. Custom store backends can be passed to `create_mcp_cli`.

### Middleware

Identity middleware runs automatically in HTTP mode. It validates
JWTs, loads the full user record from the store, and sets the
`current_user` ContextVar. No configuration needed.

See [docs/custom-middleware.md](docs/custom-middleware.md) for
advanced middleware configuration.

### Two App Patterns

Both data-owning and API-proxy apps use the same framework. The difference is what the SDK reads from the user context.

**Data-owning app** (owns user data — food logs, notes, etc.):

```python
# my_data_app/sdk/core.py
from mcp_app.context import current_user
from mcp_app import get_store

class MySDK:
    def save_entry(self, data):
        user = current_user.get()
        store = get_store()
        store.save(user.email, "entries/today", data)
```

The SDK reads `current_user.get().email` to scope data. The store holds per-user app data.

**API-proxy app** (wraps an external API — financial data, Google Workspace, etc.):

```python
# my_proxy/sdk/core.py
from mcp_app.context import current_user
import httpx

class MySDK:
    def list_items(self):
        user = current_user.get()
        token = user.profile["token"]
        resp = httpx.get("https://api.example.com/items",
                         headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"})
        return resp.json()
```

The SDK reads `current_user.get().profile` for the backend credential. The profile was saved at registration time and loaded in one read with the auth record.

**What's identical:** store setup, admin endpoints, tool discovery, deployment. The middleware is the same. The SDK decides what to read from the user context.

### Tool Discovery

The `tools` module is imported and all public async functions (not starting with `_`) are registered as MCP tools. Function names become tool names. Docstrings become descriptions. Type hints become schemas.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `SIGNING_KEY` | For HTTP | none — required | JWT signing key. Must be set for HTTP mode. |
| `JWT_AUD` | No | None (skip) | Token audience validation |
| `APP_USERS_PATH` | No | `~/.local/share/{name}/users/` | Per-user data directory |
| `TOKEN_DURATION_SECONDS` | No | 315360000 (~10yr) | Default token lifetime |

## User Identity and Profile

Every mcp-app solution has a `current_user` ContextVar set before tools execute. No default — tools that run without an established identity return an error.

| Transport | How it's set |
|-----------|-------------|
| HTTP (`my-app-mcp serve`) | Identity middleware validates JWT, loads full user record from store |
| stdio (`my-app-mcp stdio`) | CLI loads user record from store using `--user` flag |

The SDK reads it:

```python
from mcp_app.context import current_user

user = current_user.get()
user.email       # "alice@example.com" (HTTP) or "local" (stdio)
user.profile     # dict or typed Pydantic model — whatever was saved at registration
```

### Profile

The user record includes an optional `profile` field — app-specific data saved at registration time (backend credentials, preferences, config). mcp-app stores it and loads it but does not interpret it.

For typed profile access, the app registers a Pydantic model:

```python
# my_app/__init__.py
from pydantic import BaseModel
from mcp_app.context import register_profile

class Profile(BaseModel):
    token: str

register_profile(Profile)
```

Now `user.profile.token` is typed and validated. If no model is registered, `user.profile` is a raw dict.

### User registration with profile

```bash
# Data-owning app — no profile needed
mcp-app users add alice@example.com

# API-proxy app — profile contains backend credential
mcp-app users add alice@example.com --profile '{"token": "api-key-xxx"}'
```

### stdio identity

stdio user identity is always specified via the `--user` flag:

```bash
mcp-app stdio --user local
my-app-mcp stdio --user alice@example.com
```

The CLI loads the user record from the store and sets `current_user`.
Refuses to start without `--user`.

## Admin Endpoints

REST admin endpoints are mounted at `/admin` in HTTP mode:

- `POST /admin/users` — register user (with optional profile), returns JWT
- `GET /admin/users` — list users
- `DELETE /admin/users/{email}` — revoke user
- `POST /admin/tokens` — issue new token for existing user

Gated by admin-scoped JWT (`scope: "admin"`, same signing key).

## Local Testing

Validate the full stack in-memory — no server, no Docker, no cloud:

```python
from mcp_app.bootstrap import build_asgi
from my_app.mcp import tools
import httpx

app, mcp, store = build_asgi("my-app", tools)
transport = httpx.ASGITransport(app=app)
client = httpx.AsyncClient(transport=transport, base_url="http://test")
```

`build_asgi()` returns the same ASGI app the CLI gives to uvicorn.
httpx runs it in-process. If it works here, it works in Docker.
httpx is already a dependency of mcp-app.

See CONTRIBUTING.md for full test examples.

## Deployment

mcp-app is a standard Python app. Deploy it however you deploy Python.

### Bare metal (no container)

```bash
pip install -e .
SIGNING_KEY=your-key my-app-mcp serve
```

For development or simple VPS deployments. Runs uvicorn on port 8080.

### Docker (any container platform)

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install -e .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["my-app-mcp", "serve"]
```

```bash
# Build and run locally
docker build -t my-app .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e SIGNING_KEY=your-key my-app
```

This Dockerfile works on any platform that runs containers.

### Google Cloud Run (source deploy — no Docker needed)

```bash
gcloud run deploy my-app \
  --source . \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars SIGNING_KEY=your-key
```

Builds in the cloud. No local Docker install required. If a Dockerfile
exists it uses it; otherwise Google Cloud Buildpacks detect the Python app.

### gapp (fastest path to Cloud Run)

[gapp](https://github.com/echomodel/gapp) handles Dockerfile generation,
secrets, and data volumes:

```yaml
# gapp.yaml
public: true
env:
  - name: SIGNING_KEY
    secret:
      generate: true
  - name: APP_USERS_PATH
    value: "{{SOLUTION_DATA_PATH}}/users"
```

```bash
gapp deploy
```

No Dockerfile to write.

gapp config options:
- `service.entrypoint` — ASGI module:app path, wrapped with uvicorn
- `service.cmd` — raw command (e.g., `my-app-mcp serve`)

### FastMCP without mcp-app

If using FastMCP directly, the same deployment options
work. The Dockerfile CMD and gapp config differ:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile for FastMCP
CMD ["uvicorn", "my_app.mcp.server:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8080"]
```

```yaml
# gapp.yaml for FastMCP
service:
  entrypoint: my_app.mcp.server:app
```

```bash
# Bare metal for FastMCP
uvicorn my_app.mcp.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

### Deployment matrix

| | Bare metal | Docker | gcloud --source | gapp |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **mcp-app** | `my-app-mcp serve` | `CMD ["my-app-mcp", "serve"]` | needs Dockerfile | `service.cmd` |
| **FastMCP** | `uvicorn module:app` | `CMD ["uvicorn", "..."]` | needs Dockerfile | `service.entrypoint` |

mcp-app doesn't know about gapp. gapp doesn't know about mcp-app's internals.
Deploy anywhere — the framework serves an ASGI app on a port.

### MCP Client Configuration

#### CLI-based registration

**Claude Code (stdio — local):**
```bash
claude mcp add my-app -- my-app-mcp stdio --user local
```

**Claude Code (HTTP — remote):**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http my-app \
  https://your-service.run.app/ \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Gemini CLI (stdio — local):**
```bash
gemini mcp add my-app -- my-app-mcp stdio --user local
```

#### Manual configuration (JSON)

**Claude Code / Gemini CLI (remote):**

Add to `~/.claude.json` or `~/.gemini/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-app": {
      "url": "https://your-service.run.app/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude.ai / Claude mobile / Claude Code (remote via URL):**
```
https://your-service.run.app/?token=YOUR_TOKEN
```

Remote MCP servers added through Claude.ai are available across all
Claude clients — web, mobile app, and Claude Code — without separate
configuration for each.

## Architecture

mcp-app wraps [FastMCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) (the official MCP Python SDK) and [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) (ASGI framework). Solutions never import these directly — mcp-app handles all wiring.

```
create_mcp_cli("my-app", tools_module=tools)
    → discovers async functions in tools module
    → registers each as FastMCP tool (with identity enforcement)
    → creates data store from app name
    → HTTP (serve): wraps with identity middleware + admin endpoints → uvicorn
    → stdio (--user): loads user record from store → FastMCP over stdin/stdout
```

## Free Tests for Your App

mcp-app ships reusable test modules that check auth, user admin,
JWT enforcement, CLI wiring, and tool protocol compliance against
your specific app. Import them in two files, provide your `App`
object as a fixture, and get 25+ tests for free. See
[docs/app-development.md](docs/app-development.md) for setup.
